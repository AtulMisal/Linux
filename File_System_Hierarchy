Hi Connections,
   Here I wrote some inportant File System Hierarchy in Linux which will help you to understand the file system.
   
   1. /        --- It indicates root directory. When you give ls command it will show some directories as -
   
   2. /home    --- Home directory for other user's. User's created by us.
   
   3. /root    --- It is home directory for root user
   
   4. /boot    --- It contains bootable files for linux.
   
   5. /etc     --- It contains all configuration files.
   
   6. /usr     --- By default software are installed in this directory
   
   7. /bin     --- It contains command used by all user'show
   
   8. /sbin    --- It contains command used by only root user
   
   9. /opt     --- Optional appication software package, any software package can be stored here.
   
   10. /dev    --- Essential device files can be stored here.
